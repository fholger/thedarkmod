# local = True means the customized recipe is used instead of one from conan-center.
# explanation of package bintype:
#   * header
#       these deps are header-only, hence they don't need per-configuration builds
#   * release
#       these deps can be built only once in release mode, and then used both in release and debug builds
#       this is possible only for pure C libraries built with /MT, and needs /nodefaultlib:LIBCMT.lib flag in debug build
#   * vcdebug
#       these deps must be built separately for each configuration on MSVC (both debug and release)
#       this is required for C++ libs because iterator debugging and runtime differences are not allowed by MSVC
# explanation of package incltype:
#   * [default]
#       include files of this library are exactly the same on all platforms, os-es and builds
#   * os:
#       include files are different depending on OS, and should not be put into same directory in artefacts
#       this happens for libraries which generate configuration header depending on build platform
