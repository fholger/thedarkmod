/** Step in 2-pixel intervals since we already blurred against neighbors in the

    performance at the expense of some dithering artifacts.

    Morgan found that a scale of 3 left a 1-pixel checkerboard grid that was
    unobjectionable after shading was applied but eliminated most temporal incoherence
    from using small numbers of sample taps.
