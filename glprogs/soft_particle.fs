	//   texture[1]   _currentDepth
	//
	// Constants set by the engine:
	//   program.env[4] is reciprocal of _currentDepth size. Lets us convert a screen position to a texcoord in _currentDepth
	//   program.env[5] is the particle radius, given as { radius, 1/(fadeRange), 1/radius }
	//		fadeRange is the particle diameter for alpha blends (like smoke), but the particle radius for additive
	// 		blends (light glares), because additive effects work differently. Fog is half as apparent when a wall
	// 		is in the middle of it. Light glares lose no visibility when they have something to reflect off.
	//   program.env[6] is the color channel mask. Particles with additive blend need their RGB channels modifying to blend them out.
	//                                             Particles with an alpha blend need their alpha channel modifying.

	// Hard-coded constants
	//    depth_consts allows us to recover the original depth in Doom units of anything in the depth
	//    buffer. TDM's projection matrix differs slightly from the classic projection matrix as it
	//    implements a "nearly-infinite" zFar. The matrix is hard-coded in the engine, so we use hard-coded
	//    constants here for efficiency. depth_consts is derived from the numbers in that matrix.
